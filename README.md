# Multi-FASTA-File-Combiner

## Introduction

This Python script allows you to combine multiple single FASTA files into a single multi-FASTA file. It's a handy utility for researchers working in bioinformatics and genomics.

## Requirements
Python 3.6+

## Operating System
Windows, macOS, or Linux

## Example
Suppose you have three single FASTA files (file1.fasta, file2.fasta, and file3.fasta) in a directory. After running the script, they will be combined into a single multi-FASTA file named combined.fasta.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Place your single FASTA files in a directory.
3. Modify the `input_directory` and `output_file` variables in the script to specify your input directory and desired output file name.
4. Run the script using Python.

```bash
python combine_fasta.py
